# 🧪 Application Test Guide

## ✅ Setup Verification

Your Travel Itinerary Generator is now running successfully! Here's how to test it:

### 🌐 Access the Application
- Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**
- You should see the beautiful glassmorphism UI with the travel theme

### 🔑 API Key Verification
- The Gemini API key is already configured in `.env.local`
- The application will use this key to generate real itineraries

### 🧪 Test the Features

#### 1. **Form Input**
- Enter a city name (e.g., "Paris", "Tokyo", "New York")
- Select a budget range
- Choose number of days (1-14)
- Click "Generate My Itinerary"

#### 2. **AI Generation**
- The app will call Gemini API to create a personalized itinerary
- This may take 10-30 seconds depending on API response time
- You'll see a loading spinner during generation

#### 3. **Results Display**
- Day-by-day itinerary cards will appear
- Each day shows activities, dining, and timing
- Interactive maps for each day with location markers
- Trip summary with highlights and recommendations

#### 4. **Interactive Features**
- Click on day cards to expand/collapse details
- Interactive maps with color-coded markers
- Dark mode toggle in the top right
- Save to localStorage functionality
- PDF download capability

### 🗺️ Map Testing
- Maps use OpenStreetMap (free tiles)
- Location markers are color-coded by type
- Click markers for location details
- "View on Map" links open full OpenStreetMap

### 💾 Storage Features
- Itineraries are automatically saved to localStorage
- Refresh the page to test persistence
- Use "New Search" to start over

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Test on different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Touch-friendly interactions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Maps Don't Load
- Check internet connection
- Open browser console for errors
- Maps require external OpenStreetMap tiles

### If API Calls Fail
- Verify Gemini API key in `.env.local`
- Check API quota limits
- Review browser console for error messages

### If Styling Issues
- Clear browser cache
- Restart the development server
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **Form Submission**: Smooth validation and submission
2. **API Response**: Real AI-generated itineraries (not pre-defined)
3. **Map Integration**: Interactive maps with real coordinates
4. **Animations**: Smooth Framer Motion transitions
5. **Dark Mode**: Theme switching with persistence
6. **PDF Export**: Downloadable itinerary documents
7. **Local Storage**: Persistent data across sessions

## 🌟 Success Indicators

- ✅ Beautiful glassmorphism UI loads
- ✅ Form accepts input and validates
- ✅ Gemini API generates real itineraries
- ✅ Interactive maps display with markers
- ✅ Day cards expand/collapse smoothly
- ✅ Dark mode toggle works
- ✅ PDF download generates files

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once testing is complete:
1. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify for production
2. Add your own Gemini API key for production use
3. Customize colors and branding as needed
4. Add additional features like image integration
